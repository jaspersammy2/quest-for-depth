# I am lazy

I am mentally lazy. I avoid work quite strenuously. There are a few reasons for this.

#### Doing something creates risks of failure
The more that I create, the more that can break. I am taking a risk whenever I make anything. Failure seems eminent to me and harrows my mind.

#### Effort means I am doing something wrong
I expect most things to be easy and, as a consequence, anything difficult means I am not utilising some technology. The . I would prefer to spend my time seeking a ready-made solution rather than working on what I currently have. It's the opposite of the sunk-cost fallacy.

#### Effort means I am not intelligent
This is a classic symptom/cause of a fixed-mindset. Me exerting effort means that I don't have enough intelligence to properly figure something out. It is a sign of my shortcoming.

#### Inherent laziness
The brain optimises. When learning a new skill, much more of the brain and body will be used. When learning to drive a car the whole body is tense and it is difficult to have a discussion at the same time.  With practise, only the mini um necessary muscles are recruited and the neural circuity in the brain has become streamlined freeing up neural circuitry to engage in a discussion.

#### Boredom
After enough repetition, any task will become boring. This makes it even more difficult to engage.

#### I am always on the backfoot

# Consequences

#### My mind and actions becomes limited
When every turn is lined with unassailable difficulties, it makes sense to stay in one place.

#### I don't engage in any meaningful work
An unfortunate axiomatic relation is directed effort ~ meaning. Without meaning, I float around scared to uncover injurious events that force me to reflect on my life. My lack of progress, especially when compared to peers, makes me feel left behind and worthless.

# What to do?
Because of this natural tendency, I will need something external to pull me out. What I suggest is: mnemonics, willpower, goals, and scheduling.

#### Two rewards
Try to see two rewards in my activities: getting a task done, practice at exerting effort on difficult tasks.

#### Goals
What would make me feel good? As difficult as it is to say this - just getting stuff done. Getting my day-to-day work tasks complete everyday would give me a sense of accomplishment. Here's the risk: making something useful may be feel good.

#### Persistence

#### Growth mindset

#### Practise working at difficult tasks
This is a lazy suggestion in itself.
